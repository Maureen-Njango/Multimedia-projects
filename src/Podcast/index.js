        Hello, We are Techchix, and welcome to the ‘The Women In Tech’ podcast,<br></br> where we cover all things robotic in K12 education! Today we have the young women ,<br></br> who are software Developers, and semi-professional Battle Bot makers. We’re going to talk about the<br></br> latest news of women in tech and how some of them got started to become who they are now.<br></br> I’m looking forward to an interesting fun interview with tech women.
